## Description

Its objective is to centralize in one environment all content pertinent to or related to the subjects in which students are currently enrolled or also to specific topics present in their course. It is a way of bringing together an additional layer of knowledge, through the collection of content available on the internet that is analyzed by students and teachers.

Very useful for reinforcing an important concept covered in class, giving the student the opportunity to have contact with another didactic perspective, also to give consistency and depth to some study that was done superficially in the classroom.

This content is shared through links (url) that direct to videos, websites, or articles, documentation relating to the discipline. The content remains available in this sharing space and can be deleted by the student who posted the url, however the teacher has the power to delete some type of content that was shared, if he does not deem it relevant to the context of the course. 
Each enrolled student has their ID record and also has subjects in which they are enrolled. Simply fill in the rm field providing your enrollment record and the desired subject.
